# 🎤 AI Interview Coach

**An AI-powered interview practice platform with intelligent feedback**

---

## 🚀 Overview

AI Interview Coach is a Flutter-based app designed to simulate real interview panels.  
It allows users to practice interviews, receive structured feedback, and improve communication skills.

The project focuses on **core interview intelligence**, with a roadmap for multimodal inputs like voice and camera analysis.

## 🎯 Problem

Traditional interview prep is often:
- Static (question banks)
- One-way (no real conversation)
- Generic (no personalized feedback)

Candidates struggle to know **how they perform**, **where they are weak**, and **how to improve**.

## 💡 Solution

- **Interactive AI Interview Chat**  
  Gemini-based AI asks questions, follows up, and evaluates responses.
- **Mock Interview Quiz**  
  Predefined questions with structured evaluation.
- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Controlled AI behavior ensures realistic and useful interviews.
- **Scalable Architecture**  
  Easily extendable for speech and camera-based analysis.
